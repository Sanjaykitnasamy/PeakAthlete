                <p>
                    In the combat sport of boxing, two opponents square off in a ring with the goal of defeating the other through punches and blows to the body and head. Boxing is adored by fans for its drama and intensity, but it also requires physical fitness, skill, strategy, and mental toughness. The origins of boxing can be found in the popular combat sports of the time in ancient civilizations like Greece and Rome. The modern form of boxing, however, emerged in England in the 18th century and spread quickly throughout the globe. Millions of viewers tune in to professional boxing matches today to watch boxers compete for championship titles. Physical strength, speed, and agility are necessary for boxing. Boxers engage in rigorous training that includes running, weightlifting, and sparring to hone their abilities and endurance. As boxing demands quick thinking, strategic planning, and the capacity to endure physical and mental pain, they also need to have strong mental toughness. In boxing, punches are delivered to opponents using the fists of the fighters, and points are awarded for hits to the head and body. The aim of the fight is to either knock out the opponent or win by decision, depending on how many punches are thrown and how well they are thrown. Fighting in boxing requires both offensive and defensive skills, and to avoid being struck, fighters use their footwork, head movements, and blocking maneuvers. Boxing is also well-known for its fervent supporters and fighter rivalries. When a fight airs on television or in an arena, spectators gather to cheer on their favorite boxers and revel in their victories. The heavyweight championship is the most prestigious in boxing, and some of the most well-known boxers in the sport's history include Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, and Floyd Mayweather Jr.                </p>

                National boxing, also referred to as amateur boxing, is a combat sport in which two competitors square off while wearing protective gear, punching each other in the upper body and head. The sport's goal is to score points by hitting the opponent's body or head with clean punches while dodging your own blows.<br>
                Since many successful professional boxers began their careers as amateurs, amateur boxing is frequently seen as a stepping stone to professional boxing. Men's boxing was first added to the Olympic program in 1904, and women's boxing was added in 2012. The sport is also an Olympic event.<br>
                Here is a list of some of the national boxing legends:<br><br>
                Muhammad Ali<br>
                Joe Frazier<br>
                Sugar Ray Leonard<br>
                Oscar De La Hoya<br>
                Kelsey Plum<br><br>
                It is a physically demanding sport that requires a combination of skill, speed, endurance, and strength, and is often regarded as a test of an individual's mental and physical toughness.
